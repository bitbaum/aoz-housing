 * The landing page in every language that is not German.
 *
 * German keeps the unprefixed `/willkommen`; @see that file for why. This route
 * covers the rest, and `generateStaticParams` is what decides which "the rest"
 * means: it emits only the locales `publicLocales()` offers, which is only the
 * locales whose copy is actually COMPLETE for this brand. A half-translated
 * language therefore has no page at all rather than a page that silently falls
 * back to German paragraphs — the reader can tell the difference between "not
 * offered" and "offered and broken", and only one of those is honest.
 *
 * `dynamicParams = false` is the other half of that promise. Without it Next
 * renders any `/xx/willkommen` on demand, so a language nobody has written
 * would answer 200 with the German fallback at a French-looking URL.
