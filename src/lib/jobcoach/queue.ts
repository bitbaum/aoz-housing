/**
 * What a job coach has waiting — derived from evidence, not invented.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists to fix
 *
 * The dashboard decides "busy" or "quiet" from `openTaskCount`, and every
 * component of that count was a housing queue: overdue check-ins, unplaced
 * residents, pending transfers, problem units, governance proposals. A
 * Jobcoach holds none of those permissions, so the count was structurally
 * always zero.
 *
 * Observed in production on 2026-09-02: Simon B. had a client assigned that
 * same day — job-seeking, two years without work, an unrecognised trade
 * qualification, German at A2 — and his dashboard said
 * "🎉 Alles unter Kontrolle! Keine dringenden Aufgaben", without naming him.
 *
 * That is the same failure the `unassigned` state was added to fix, one level
 * deeper. Then it was "nobody is assigned to me". Now it is "somebody is, with
 * real work outstanding, and the queue cannot see it" — because the queue was
 * defined in another domain's vocabulary.
 *
 * ## Why these four signals and not others
 *
 * Each maps to a principle in `config/job-integration-docs.ts` marked
 * `status: 'signal'`. Nothing here is a hunch:
 *
 *  - INTEREST_UNANSWERED — client preference first. A resident who pressed
 *    "Ich habe Interesse" has stated the one thing IPS says predicts retention,
 *    and is now waiting for a person to reply.
 *  - NO_LABOUR_MARKET_CONTACT — place-then-train. Rapid entry into real work
 *    beats lengthy pre-training, so a client with no application and no active
 *    placement is an open task rather than a neutral state.
 *  - COURSE_WITHOUT_WORK — language and work in parallel, not sequential. A
 *    running course with no labour-market contact is exactly the lock-in
 *    pattern the IAB evidence describes, where search intensity falls during a
 *    measure.
 *  - STALLED_RECORD — an IN_PROGRESS record nobody has touched. Not a
 *    judgement about the person; a record that has stopped moving is a record
 *    nobody is working.
 *
 * Principles marked `documented` deliberately raise nothing: qualification
 * recognition, post-start support and stated job goals all matter, and the
 * product cannot currently detect them. Inventing a signal from data that does
 * not exist would be worse than the gap.
 *
 * Pure. No Prisma, no dates read from the clock — `now` is passed in, so the
 * same input always produces the same queue.
