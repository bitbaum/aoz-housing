/**
 * Who may see which of a client's own admin facts, and what "confirmed" means.
 *
 * These facts exist because extending an insurance every six months, or getting
 * a dentist appointment, meant writing to your Betreuerin and waiting. Putting
 * them in the client's profile only helps if the rules around them are as
 * careful as the reason they were kept out until now.
 *
 * Three rules, all load-bearing.
 *
 * 1. NEVER AN INPUT TO A DECISION. CLAUDE.md forbids tracking anything that
 *    could be used for discrimination. The mechanism of that harm is a field
 *    the placement algorithm, the KPIs or a staff filter can see. So these
 *    facts are readable by a person looking at one client, and by nothing that
 *    ranks, scores, sorts or aggregates. Enforced by
 *    `__tests__/never-an-input-to-a-decision.test.ts`, not by good intentions.
 *
 * 2. PER FACT, NOT PER PERSON. A Jobcoach needs the permit — it decides which
 *    work is lawful, and `permitRequirement` on an opportunity is already a
 *    claim about exactly this. A Jobcoach has no business seeing which doctors
 *    someone visits. One blanket "care team" grant would have handed over both.
 *
 * 3. CONFIRMED MEANS SEEN, NOT TRUE. Franziska cannot ring the insurer to check
 *    a policy number. A product that implied she had would be asserting
 *    something about a person's insurance or permit that it cannot know — the
 *    same failure as an opportunity defaulting to "Keine Bewilligung nötig".
 *    Every label for this state says *geprüft*, never *gültig*.
