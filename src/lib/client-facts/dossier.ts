/**
 * A client's own admin facts, as their care team sees them on the dossier.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS CLOSES A HOLE IN THE FEATURE IT BELONGS TO. `/approvals` queries
 * `status = 'PENDING'`, and nothing else on the staff side read these tables —
 * so the moment a Betreuerin pressed "Gesehen", the insurance disappeared from
 * every staff surface. She could never afterwards look up which insurance a
 * client has, or who their dentist is, which is the entire reason the client
 * recorded it.
 *
 * Written and then read by nobody: the exact class this feature was built to
 * end, reproduced inside it. Found by walking the product as Simon rather than
 * by reading the code.
 *
 * Visibility is the SAME per-kind rule as the queue (`mayReadFact`), applied
 * before the query rather than in the markup — a kind this viewer may not read
 * is a query never issued, so the rows never enter the payload.
