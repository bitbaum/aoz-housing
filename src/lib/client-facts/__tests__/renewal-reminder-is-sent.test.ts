/**
 * The reminder has to leave the building.
 *
 * WHAT SHIPPED: `expiringFacts` reached two staff PAGES, and `isMilestoneDay`
 * — the cooldown rule written for a daily check — was exported, tested, and
 * called by nothing. So the feature answered "my insurance expires every six
 * months and I have to write Franziska" with a tile that only helps the person
 * who was already looking. The comment at the top of `renewals.ts` justified
 * that: `STAFF_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` was unset, so mail reached nobody. True when
 * written; false within the week, once the variable was set and delivery
 * verified. The justification outlived the constraint.
 *
 * AND THE REMINDER MUST NOT BECOME THE LEAK. `mayReadFact` decides per person
 * which client facts they may see — an insurance is Betreuung and
 * Sozialarbeit, a permit additionally the Jobcoach, Liegenschaften neither.
 * `notifyStaff` writes to ONE shared address and cannot honour that. So the
 * mail carries a count and a link; the page behind the link applies the
 * policy. These two rules are tested together on purpose, because satisfying
 * either one alone is how this gets broken: a reminder nobody receives, or a
 * reminder that hands a permit letter to the wrong inbox.
