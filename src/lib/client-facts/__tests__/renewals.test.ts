/**
 * The reminder half of the client-facts feature.
 *
 * "My insurance has to be extended every 6 months, and for that I need to
 * write Franziska." Recording the date let a client SEE it; this is what makes
 * the date reach somebody who can act.
 *
 * The delivery choice is the part worth pinning: it is IN-APP because
 * `STAFF_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` is unset on the live box, so `notifyStaff()`
 * returns false without sending, and staff hold no accounts to address
 * individually. A mailed reminder would be a reminder that does not exist —
 * the exact class this codebase keeps producing.
