/**
 * A client's own admin facts must never reach a decision the product makes.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md forbids tracking "anything that could be used for discrimination",
 * and this feature stores insurance, health contacts and a permit category —
 * exactly the material that rule is about. What makes it consistent rather
 * than an exception is the mechanism: the harm runs through a field that the
 * placement algorithm, the KPIs, or a staff filter can see. Close that, and
 * what remains is a person's own record, held where they can reach it instead
 * of in their Betreuerin's inbox.
 *
 * "We promise not to" is not a mechanism. This is. If someone later joins
 * ClientPermit into the matching query — the single most plausible way this
 * goes wrong, because permit type genuinely correlates with things a matcher
 * would love — the build goes red here with the reason attached.
 *
 * The forbidden directories are named as PATHS, and the tables as the literal
 * strings any query must use, so the check cannot be satisfied by a rename.
