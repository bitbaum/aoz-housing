/**
 * A confirmed fact must still be findable.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS SHIPPED. `/approvals` queries `status = 'PENDING'`, and
 * for a day nothing else on the staff side read the client-fact tables at all.
 * So the moment a Betreuerin pressed "Gesehen", the insurance disappeared from
 * every staff surface: she could never afterwards look up which insurance a
 * client holds, or who their dentist is — the entire reason the client entered
 * it. Written, then read by nobody, inside the feature built to end exactly
 * that.
 *
 * It was found by walking the product as Simon, not by reading the code. No
 * test failed, because "the queue is empty" is indistinguishable from "there
 * is nothing to do".
