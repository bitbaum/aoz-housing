/**
 * Insurances and permits that are running out.
 *
 * The half of the client-facts feature that closes the original complaint:
 * "my insurance has to be extended every 6 months, and for that I need to
 * write Franziska." Recording the date lets a client SEE it; this is what
 * makes the date reach the person who can act before it lapses.
 *
 * IT IS BOTH IN-APP AND EMAIL, and the split is not arbitrary.
 *
 * In-app is the detail: `expiringFacts` feeds the dashboard and the approvals
 * queue, where `mayReadFact` decides per signed-in person which facts they may
 * see at all. Email is a POINTER ONLY — a count and a link — because
 * `notifyStaff` writes to one shared address and cannot honour that policy.
 * See `renewalReminder` in `lib/email/templates.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ The email half was DEFERRED, then forgotten, and this comment is why it
 * is worth recording. The original version of this file argued that email was
 * impossible here: `STAFF_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` was unset on the live box, so
 * `notifyStaff()` returned false without sending. That was true when written
 * and stopped being true the same week, when the variable was set and delivery
 * verified. What survived was `isMilestoneDay` — exported, tested, and called
 * by nothing, the cooldown rule for a reminder that never fired. A constraint
 * written into a comment outlives the constraint itself; when the blocker is
 * an environment variable, say so where someone will trip over it.
