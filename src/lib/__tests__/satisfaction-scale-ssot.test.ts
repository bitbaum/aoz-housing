/**
 * One satisfaction scale, defined once.
 *
 * There were three. `SATISFACTION_EMOJIS` in constants was the SSOT, and two
 * components had each written their own array literal — both starting 😢 where
 * the SSOT starts 😞. Nobody noticed, because a differently-sad face is not a
 * failure of anything: it type-checks, it lints, it renders. The scale a
 * resident saw in the portal and the one staff saw on the placements list were
 * simply not the same scale, and any comparison between them was quietly
 * comparing two different instruments.
 *
 * A copy of a five-element emoji array is trivially cheap to write and
 * impossible to spot in review, so the rule is enforced rather than documented:
 * the faces live in ONE file and every renderer imports them.
