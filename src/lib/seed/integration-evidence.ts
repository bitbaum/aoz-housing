/**
 * The integration half of the demo world: what people are learning and doing.
 *
 * Without this, `/learning` renders a board with five zeroes and an empty
 * list, the dashboard's "Lernen" pulse reads 0 laufend / 0 abgeschlossen, and
 * a Jobcoach evaluating the product concludes the whole Integration pillar is
 * unbuilt. It is built; it had no data. Housing, expenses and governance were
 * all seeded — this pillar was the one that shipped blank.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS ASSIGNED AT RANDOM. Every record is DERIVED from the
 * resident's own profile, because evidence that contradicts the person it
 * describes is worse than no evidence:
 *
 *   - someone whose `languages` already list German holds a German test, so
 *     they do NOT appear in the board's "Kein Deutsch-Test erfasst" panel;
 *   - someone whose languages do not is in a German course instead, and DOES
 *     appear there — which is what makes that panel show real work rather
 *     than either everyone or nobody;
 *   - only working-age residents get vocational records;
 *   - volunteering goes to the people whose `choresContribution` already says
 *     they do unpaid work for the household.
 *
 * Deterministic on purpose (no Math.random): the same database yields the
 * same world, so a demo can be described in advance and a test can assert on
 * it. Variation comes from the resident's position in the code-sorted list.
 *
 * Shared by BOTH seeds — the demo world (lib/demo/seed-data.ts) and the
 * development dataset (prisma/seed.ts) — which is why it lives here and not
 * under lib/demo/. It takes resident ids and reads their profiles itself, so
 * neither caller has to thread anything through.
 *
 * Relative-import-safe (no '@/' aliases): loaded through ts-node.
