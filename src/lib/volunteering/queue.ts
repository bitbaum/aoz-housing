/**
 * What the Freiwilligenarbeit coordinator has waiting.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists to fix
 *
 * Sandra's dashboard could not show her an open task. Not "rarely did" —
 * could not. `totalIssues` is built from critical incidents, overdue
 * check-ins, unplaced residents, pending transfers, proposals awaiting staff
 * and the job queue. She holds none of the permissions gating the first five,
 * and the sixth was fetched with `careAssignment.role = 'JOB'` while her seats
 * are `VOLUNTEERING`. Every term was structurally zero, so the dashboard
 * resolved to `quiet` and congratulated her — every morning, with work sitting
 * in the database.
 *
 * This is the identical defect fixed for Simon on 2026-09-02, whose fix comment
 * sits three lines above the hardcoded `'JOB'` that excluded her. **The fix was
 * applied to the instance and not the class.** That is why the builder now
 * lives in `lib/care/queue.ts` and this file holds only what is specific to
 * volunteering.
 *
 * ## Why these signals and not a copy of the job ones
 *
 * The job signals ask about the labour market: has this person had contact,
 * are they on a course with no work alongside it. Neither question is Sandra's.
 * Hers is whether the people she holds are actually doing something with other
 * people, and whether anyone answered the ones who asked.
