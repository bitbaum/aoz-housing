/**
 * Whose turn it is on a scheduled chore.
 *
 * DERIVED, NEVER STORED. The turn is a pure function of the task's rotation
 * order and how many times the task has been completed. Nothing to keep in
 * sync, so the turn can never drift from the completion log — the log stays the
 * single source of truth for what actually happened.
 *
 * WHY A ROTATION AT ALL, when an honor system already allocates these tasks
 * perfectly well: the rota's value is not allocative, it is de-escalatory. With
 * one, the demand comes from the plan rather than from your housemate. What a
 * rota actually minimises is having to ask — and asking is the expensive part,
 * because in a house nobody chose and nobody can leave, one badly-received ask
 * is what a staff mediation hour gets spent on.
 *
 * A TURN IS A DEFAULT, NOT A LOCK. Anyone may complete any task at any time;
 * doing it early is allowed and the balance credits whoever did it. Swapping is
 * a first-class move rather than a violation, because voluntary trade is how
 * you approximate envy-freeness without ever asking anyone to rank chores.

/**
 * The resident whose turn it currently is, or `null` when the task has no

 * Completions advance the turn regardless of who performed them: if Alex does
 * Misha's turn, the work is done and the rota moves on. Anything else would
 * make covering for someone cost you your own place in the queue.
