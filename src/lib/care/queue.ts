/**
 * What a specialist has waiting — the shape, shared by every care domain.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists, and it is not "tidiness"
 *
 * `lib/jobcoach/queue.ts` documents a bug fixed for Simon on 2026-09-02: the
 * dashboard decided "busy" or "quiet" from a count made entirely of housing
 * queues, so a specialist's count was structurally zero and the product
 * congratulated him on a day with real work in it.
 *
 * That fix was written for ONE coach. Sandra sat next to it with the identical
 * defect — her caseload was never even fetched, because the query hardcoded
 * `careAssignment.role = 'JOB'` and her seats are `VOLUNTEERING` — and every
 * other term in the count needs permissions she does not hold. She has been
 * getting "Alles unter Kontrolle" every morning since.
 *
 * So the lesson is not the fix, it is the shape of the mistake: **a fix applied
 * to the instance rather than the class**. Putting the builder here is what
 * makes the third domain free instead of a third copy — and copies of a fix rot
 * one at a time, silently, which is how this happened in the first place.

 * Contact means a person engaged. A click is a request for one. This is domain
