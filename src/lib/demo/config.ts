 * public BY DESIGN; safety comes from the reset (api/cron/reset-demo), the
 * login rate limit, and the operator opt-in via env.
 *
 * ⚠️ THERE IS NO LONGER A DEMO WORLD TO RESET. The fabricated one — 15
 * invented residents in 5 `DEMO-` units, truncated and re-seeded nightly — was
 * deleted from production on 2026-09-08 along with its seed, its two reset
 * scopes and its cron endpoint. What remains here is the DOOR: which no-account
 * logins this deployment offers into the real product.
 *
 * The data behind that door is now real flats holding CLAIMABLE PLACEHOLDER
 * profiles (`scripts/db/seed-placeholders.ts`), which persist precisely because
 * a profile you can take over must survive the night.
 *
 * Relative-import-safe (no '@/' aliases): seeding scripts load this through
 * ts-node, which does not resolve tsconfig path aliases.
