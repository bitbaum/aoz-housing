/**
 * Every door the demo offers — one per staff role, plus the resident.
 *
 * The product is only understandable from the inside, and it looks completely
 * different depending on who you are: Leitung sees the whole register, a
 * Jobcoach sees learning and the people they coach, a resident sees their own
 * flat. A demo that offers a single staff door shows one of those five and
 * calls it "the app".
 *
 * The list is DERIVED from `STAFF_ROLES` rather than written out again, so a
 * new role gets a door by existing. A hand-maintained second list is how the
 * demo ends up silently missing the role somebody added last month.
 *
 * Codes are derived too — `<brand prefix>DEMO-<role>` — so a rebrand carries
 * them along and nothing has to be re-typed into an env file. They are public
 * BY DESIGN: safety comes from the deployment opt-in (`DEMO_ACCESS_ENABLED`),
 * the per-IP rate limit, and the fact that a demo instance must hold only
 * seeded data.
 *
 * Relative-import-safe (no '@/' aliases): reached from ts-node seeds.
