/**
 * Demo reset — wipe drive-by edits, restore the pristine presentation state.
 *
 * Called daily by api/cron/reset-demo (systemd timer on the box) and by the
 * CLI seed (prisma/seed-demo.ts). Four steps:
 *
 *   1. Truncate every table EXCEPT the keep-list. Enumerating from pg_tables
 *      (rather than a hand-maintained deleteMany list) means a new model added
 *      to the schema is wiped automatically — the old seed's explicit list had
 *      already gone stale against the governance tables.
 *   2. Reseed the presentation narrative (seed-data.ts).
 *   3. Upsert the demo accounts, so a visitor who renamed or broke the demo
 *      staff user self-heals. Real staff accounts live in the kept User table
 *      and are never touched.
 *   4. Re-sync the AOZ rule catalog — the truncate wiped HouseRule, and the
 *      governance pages are inert without it. Idempotent by design.
 *
 * Relative-import-safe (no '@/' aliases): prisma/seed-demo.ts loads this
 * through ts-node, which does not resolve tsconfig path aliases.
