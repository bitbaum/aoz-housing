/**
 * Loading the caseload a role's KPIs are computed over.
 *
 * Kept apart from `role-kpis.ts` on purpose: the arithmetic there is pure and
 * unit-tested, this is I/O. The same split `lib/jobcoach/queue.ts` already uses,
 * and the reason the KPI rules can be proven without a database.
 *
 * ## Whose caseload
 *
 * A specialist is measured on the people THEY hold — that is the point of a
 * per-role KPI, and a product-wide number would recreate the aggregate that
 * told Simon "23 laufend" while his own board showed nothing.
 *
 * A viewer with reach over every domain has no single seat, so they see the
 * whole real population instead: for them these are pilot numbers, not a
 * personal scorecard.
 *
 * Demo rows never count, in either case. @see ./real-data.ts
