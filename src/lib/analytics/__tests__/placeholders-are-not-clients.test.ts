/**
 * A seeded profile is not a client until someone claims it.
 *
 * Placeholder rows exist so a real person can take one over: plausible name,
 * real flat, real code, `isPlaceholder: true`. Until that takeover happens
 * there is nobody behind the row, and every pilot KPI has to say so.
 *
 * THE DIRECTION OF THE ERROR IS WHAT MAKES THIS URGENT. A placeholder left in
 * the numbers does not merely inflate a headcount — it reads as a client with
 * no labour-market contact, no German level recorded and no first meeting. So
 * the more placeholders exist to demonstrate the product, the WORSE the service
 * looks in the numbers it is judged on. Same failure as demo conflicts
 * reporting "67% mehr Konflikte · Verschlechterung", from the other side.
 *
 * And the opposite mistake is just as real: Ihor, Misha, Alex and Julia are
 * REAL clients who have never registered an account. Deriving "is a person"
 * from "has an Account" would erase four of the five people actually being
 * served. Placeholder-ness is provenance, fixed when the row is created.
