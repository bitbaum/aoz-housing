/**
 * Which housing counts as CAPACITY — one definition, three call sites.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists to end
 *
 * `totalBeds` was summed over every unit regardless of status, and free beds is
 * `totalBeds − occupiedBeds`. So a CLOSED building contributed beds nobody can
 * be placed into, and the dashboard advertised them as free.
 *
 * That was harmless while the database held only units AOZ actually runs. It
 * stopped being harmless on 2026-09-04, when the 118 flats of Witikonerstrasse
 * 426–468 were entered from the federal register: a terrace under demolition
 * order, most of which AOZ may not hold. Their beds are 0 today precisely
 * BECAUSE of this bug — the moment anyone types a real bed count into a flat
 * that is not yet in service, Franziska's "Freie Plätze" tile inflates.
 *
 * Capacity you cannot place anyone into is not capacity. It is worse than a
 * missing number, because it reads as headroom during exactly the conversation
 * where headroom decides whether somebody gets a bed tonight.
 *
 * ## Where the line sits, and why not one step further
 *
 * `MAINTENANCE` still counts. A flat being repaired is stock AOZ holds and will
 * get back; excluding it would make occupancy jump every time a shower breaks
 * and drop again when it is fixed, which would read as a placement trend that
 * never happened.
 *
 * `CLOSED` does not count. It means the unit is not in service — not yet
 * commissioned, handed back, or awaiting demolition. Nobody can be placed
 * there, so it is not headroom.
