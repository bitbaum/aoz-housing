/**
 * The integration domain splits in two, and BOTH pages that serve it split the
 * same way: `/learning` is what somebody has already done, `/opportunities` is
 * where they could go next. Simon works the job half, Sandra the volunteering
 * half, Franziska sees everything.
 *
 * The board identity and the role default live here so those two pages cannot
 * come to disagree about which half a coach works in. What a board CONTAINS
 * stays with each page — learning boards hold courses and qualifications, which
 * are records and not places, and never will be.
 *
 * Why a default rather than a filter the coach sets: a filter that every user
 * sets to the same value on every visit is a question the product already knows
 * the answer to. `User.role` is that answer. The board stays switchable, so the
 * default costs nothing to the one person who wants the other half.
