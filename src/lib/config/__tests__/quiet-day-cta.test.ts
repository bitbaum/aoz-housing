/**
 * On a quiet day, a specialist is sent to their OWN board.
 *
 * `DASHBOARD_FALLBACK_CTAS` is ordered by permission alone, and its second
 * entry is `learning:write` — documented in that file as "the coaching roles'
 * home". True of a Jobcoach. False of the Freiwilligenarbeit coordinator, who
 * also holds `learning:write`: Sandra's "Alles unter Kontrolle" screen offered
 * her one button, and it opened Simon's surface.
 *
 * Found by opening her dashboard during a walk of the live product. Nothing
 * failed, because a CTA that resolves is indistinguishable from a CTA that
 * resolves CORRECTLY.
