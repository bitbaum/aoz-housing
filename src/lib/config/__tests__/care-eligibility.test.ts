/**
 * A client's team may only name people who could actually do that job.
 *
 * The picker on a client's page offered EVERY active account for EVERY seat,
 * because `listAssignableStaff` selected `role` and read it nowhere. So Manuel
 * — `LIEGENSCHAFTEN`, a role that maps to no care domain at all — was offered
 * as a Jobcoach, and Simon was offered as Freiwilligenarbeit.
 *
 * `saveCareSeat` did not stop it either: it checks who is EDITING the seat,
 * never who is being NAMED in it. So the mistake was one click away, and a
 * wrongly staffed seat looks exactly like a correctly staffed one afterwards —
 * the client appears covered, and the person named never sees them on any
 * queue, because every queue is built from `careAssignment.role` matching
 * their own domain.
