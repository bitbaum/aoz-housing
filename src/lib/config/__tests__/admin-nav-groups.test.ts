/**
 * The admin nav, checked against EVERY role — which is the whole point.
 *
 * `AdminSidebar.test.tsx` has forbidden one-item accordions since the sidebar
 * shipped, and it asserted it for ADMIN: the one viewer whose groups are always
 * full, so the rule could never fire. Walked live on 2026-09-03, Simon
 * (JOBCOACH) had THREE one-item accordions and Sandra had the same, with the
 * suite green throughout.
 *
 * That is the same shape as the portal defect CLAUDE.md documents — a group
 * named "Zusammen entscheiden" holding nothing to decide, because the check ran
 * against a configuration where the group was full. `portal-nav-groups.test.ts`
 * fixed it there by testing every brand's flags. This is the staff-side twin:
 * test every role, because the ROLE is what empties a group here.
