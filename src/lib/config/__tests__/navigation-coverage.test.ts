/**
 * Navigation is only trustworthy if it is COMPLETE and UNAMBIGUOUS:
 * every page has a way in, and no destination has two ways in.
 *
 * Both halves had failed at once. "Integration" was three menu entries
 * (`/learning?board=overview|job|volunteering`) pointing at a single page that
 * already renders its own board switcher — two controls for one choice, so the
 * menu and the page could disagree about where you were. Meanwhile the reader
 * had no way to tell whether a page they could not find was missing or just
 * undiscoverable.
 *
 * Derived from the filesystem on purpose: a hand-written expectation drifts
 * exactly like the nav it is meant to guard.
