/**
 * Dashboard composition — SSOT for which role sees which dashboard surface.
 *
 * The dashboard used to hardcode the housing/placement widgets for everyone:
 * a Jobcoach or Freiwilligenarbeit coordinator logged in and saw "freie
 * Betten" and a matching CTA — none of it their work — and nothing from the
 * pillars that ARE their work (learning, events). The permission model in
 * role-policy.ts already IS the definition of "what is this person's daily
 * work"; this file only maps each dashboard section onto the permission that
 * makes the section that role's business. Consumed by the page (to skip the
 * queries a role cannot see) and by ActionDashboard (to gate rendering) —
 * one mapping, two readers, so they can never disagree.

 * Whether this workspace has nothing YET, nothing RIGHT NOW, or work waiting.

 * in it every queue is empty, so every check passed and the page reported
 * "Alles erledigt!" and "Alles unter Kontrolle!" — twice, with the same
 * button under each. Nothing was under control; there was simply nothing.
 * That is the single most misleading screen a new AOZ team could be handed,
 * because it says the setup they have not started is finished.
 *
 * Emptiness is measured in PEOPLE, not units: this product exists to support
 * residents, and a workspace with buildings and nobody in them has not begun.
 *
 * A fourth case exists one level in, and it is the same mistake at the scale
 * of one person rather than one database. A specialist works the clients
 * assigned to their seat. Before anyone has been assigned, their queues are
 * empty for a reason that has nothing to do with the work being done — yet
 * `residentCount` counts everyone in the product, so they land in `quiet` and
 * are told, with a party emoji, that everything is under control.
 *
 * Observed in production on 2026-08-31, the day the real AOZ team was
 * created: Simon Binder (Jobcoach) and Sandra (Freiwilligenarbeit) both saw
 * "🎉 Alles unter Kontrolle! Keine dringenden Aufgaben" on their first ever
 * login, with nobody assigned to either of them. That is the first thing the
 * two specialists AOZ actually employs were told by this product.
 *
 * `residentCount` stays global on purpose — a Jobcoach must not be told the
 * workspace is empty while 19 people sit in it, which is why it was made
 * global in the first place. So this is a separate axis, not a redefinition.
