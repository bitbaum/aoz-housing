/**
 * The public landing page — the only surface that speaks to someone who has
 * never logged in — in every language it is written in.
 *
 * TWO AXES, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THING.
 *
 * BRAND is a build-time fact. One deployment is one brand, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND`
 * is inlined at build, and a reader cannot switch it. It selects the REGISTER:
 * `aoz`/`aozh` address an organisation deciding whether to place people with
 * software; `wg` runs in a real shared flat where nobody is "placed" by a
 * "system". The same page for both would be wrong for at least one of them.
 *
 * LOCALE is a per-request fact, chosen by the reader from the URL. It selects
 * the LANGUAGE within that register.
 *
 * Conflating them is what makes landing-page i18n rot: a `Record<BrandId,
 * string>` cannot hold three languages, and a `Record<LocaleId, string>` cannot
 * hold two registers, so whichever axis got modelled second ends up hand-copied
 * into the first.
 *
 * WHY THE PUBLIC PAGE DOES NOT USE THE PORTAL'S COOKIE. `src/lib/i18n/` picks
 * the resident portal's language from a cookie, which is right there: the
 * portal is behind a session and already dynamic. The public group is not —
 * `(public)/layout.tsx` touches no cookie and no database on purpose, which is
 * what keeps every page under it statically prerenderable AND makes it
 * structurally incapable of leaking resident data. Reading a cookie here would
 * spend both of those to gain nothing a URL does not already give: `/fr/...`
 * is linkable, shareable and indexable, and a cookie is none of the three.
 * The two mechanisms are different because the two constraints are different.

 * register must not withhold French from an `aoz` deployment that has it.
 *

 * other language is translated from: same keys, same list lengths, and no
 * blank strings standing in for a sentence. Comparing list LENGTHS matters as
