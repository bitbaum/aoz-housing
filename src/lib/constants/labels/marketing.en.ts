 * English.
 *
 * Translated from `marketing.de.ts`, and bound by the same restraint: no
 * number this product has not measured. The German page deliberately claims no
 * percentage reduction in conflicts and no hours saved, because the pilot has
 * not reported — and a translation is not a fresh opportunity to make a
 * stronger claim to a reader who cannot check it against the original.
 *
 * `FACTOR_COUNT` and `SOURCE_COUNT` are interpolated from the same config the
 * German page reads, never re-typed. A translator writing "27 factors" into a
 * sentence is the drift this whole file structure exists to prevent.
 *
 * NOT VOUCHED FOR by a native speaker yet — see `PUBLIC_LOCALES` in
 * `marketing.ts` for what that does and does not gate.
