/**
 * "Ansicht wechseln" — seeing the product as one of your colleagues sees it.
 *
 * A system administrator building this product cannot answer "what does a
 * Jobcoach actually see?" by reasoning about `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`. The nav, the
 * dashboard queues, the empty states and the caseload all compose, and the only
 * honest answer is to look. Until now that meant logging out and typing a real
 * colleague's login code — which requires holding three people's working
 * credentials, and is exactly the habit a product for vulnerable people should
 * not be teaching.
 *
 * ## Why the session BECOMES them, rather than re-rendering with their role
 *
 * The tempting cheap version is a "preview role" cookie that only overrides the
 * capability triple used for permission checks. It is wrong here, and in a way
 * that would quietly defeat the purpose: Simon's dashboard is driven by HIS
 * caseload — `careAssignment.staffId = <Simon>` — not by his role. A preview
 * that kept the admin's identity would render a Jobcoach-shaped nav above an
 * administrator's data and call it Simon's view. The one bug this feature
 * exists to catch (a coach told there is nothing to do while holding a client)
 * is precisely the kind that preview would hide.
 *
 * So the session really is theirs, and the token records who opened it.
 *
 * ## Why it is READ-ONLY, enforced at the request and not in the UI
 *
 * If an impersonated session could write, the audit trail would say Simon
 * archived a resident when Simon was at lunch. In a product whose whole claim
 * is that placement decisions are explainable and attributable, an audit row
 * naming the wrong caseworker is worse than no audit row.
 *
 * The enforcement point is the proxy, not the components, for the same reason
 * every other boundary in this codebase is: a rule applied where requests
 * arrive holds for routes nobody remembered to guard. Every non-GET is refused
 * — server actions are POSTs, so they are covered by the same sentence as API
 * routes, without either having to opt in.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately NOT done: the impersonated session keeps every
 * permission the real person has. Stripping `:write` would make write buttons
 * vanish, which is a DIFFERENT screen from the one the colleague sees — and
 * showing you a screen your colleague never sees is the failure mode of the
 * whole idea. So the buttons are there and pressing one is refused. The banner
 * says so.
