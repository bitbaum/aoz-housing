/**
 * Self-serve onboarding: sign up with no code and create your own household.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ONE ATOMIC OPERATION AND NOT A TWO-STEP WIZARD
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * This product has no session for an account that holds no identity. Cookies
 * are minted PER IDENTITY — `staff_session` for a `User`, `resident_code` for
 * a `Resident` — and `establishSessions()` sets whichever the account's
 * identities call for. An account with neither would therefore be logged in as
 * nothing: it could not reach a second "now create your household" screen,
 * because every guarded page resolves the viewer from one of those two cookies.
 *
 * Adding a third "account session" cookie to carry a half-finished signup would
 * mean a new authenticated state that every guard, every middleware branch and
 * every audit line has to learn about — for a state that lasts thirty seconds.
 * So the whole thing happens in one transaction instead: account, household,
 * resident and placement, or none of them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CREATE: a staff `User`.
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Staff permissions are GLOBAL. `requirePermission('residents:read')` asks what
 * role you hold, not which household you belong to, so a self-serve staff
 * account would be able to read every resident in the database — on a shared
 * deployment that is every resident of every flat. The portal is unit-scoped by
 * construction (`getPortalAuth()` resolves the viewer's current placement), so
 * the self-serve door opens onto the portal and nowhere else. A household needs
 * no administrator; it needs the people who live in it.
 *
 * Gated by `BRAND.features.selfServeHousehold`, which is OFF for AOZ. @see brand.ts

/**
 * Compatibility defaults for a person who has answered nothing yet.
 *
 * Onboarding asks for a household name and what to call you. It does NOT ask
 * for age band, gender, family status or sleep schedule, because this product's
 * first principle is to collect the minimum — and none of those are needed to
 * split a grocery bill or run a cleaning rota. They exist for MATCHING, which
 * is an AOZ placement concern and not something a flat does to itself.
 *
 * So every one of them starts neutral and the resident fills them in later at
 * /portal/preferences if they ever want matching to mean anything.
 * `preferencesCompletedAt` stays null, which is the existing signal for
 * "this person has not told us their preferences" — the same one staff-created
 * residents use, so nothing downstream needs a new case.
 *
 * `gender: PREFER_NOT_SAY` is the point, not a placeholder: the schema requires
 * a value and the honest one for a question nobody asked is the refusal.
