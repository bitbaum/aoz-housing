 *
 * These were a single enum, and the real AOZ team could not be described by it.
 * Franziska is a Betreuerin who ALSO sees every client; the only way to say
 * that was to make her ADMIN, which erased her actual domain and handed her the
 * settings page as a side effect. Simon (Jobcoach) and Sandra
 * (Freiwilligenarbeit) work one domain each.
 *
 * This used to end "There is no Leitung." — false, corrected 2026-08-31. AOZ
 * was recruiting a Programmleiter*in and a Teamleiter*in Betreuung for the
 * pilot this product is named after; only THOSE THREE PEOPLE have no lead.
 * A Teamleiter*in is BETREUUNG + ALL_DOMAINS + not isSystemAdmin, so the split
 * already expresses it — do NOT add a LEITUNG role for it.
 *
 * Ask each axis exactly one question and the team describes itself:
