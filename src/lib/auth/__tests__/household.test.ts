/**
 * Self-serve household onboarding.
 *
 * The load-bearing test here is not "does it create a flat" — it is that the
 * flow can NEVER mint a staff identity. Staff permissions are global, so a
 * self-serve staff account would read every resident in the database. That is
 * the whole reason the feature is shaped the way it is, and it is exactly the
 * kind of property that a later refactor could quietly undo.

/**
 * Two things this mock has to get right, both learned the hard way.
 *
 * 1. Keep the REAL module and override only the flag. A hand-written BRAND stub
 *    broke the suite for an unrelated reason: `logger.ts` imports
 *    ALL_CODE_PREFIXES from here to redact staff codes out of log lines, so
 *    replacing the module wholesale removed the redactor's input entirely.
 *
 * 2. The switch lives on `globalThis`, not in a module-scope `const`. Jest
 *    hoists `vi.mock` factories above the file's own declarations, so a
 *    factory closing over a local `const` reads a DIFFERENT binding than the
 *    test body mutates — the override applies (tests that need `true` pass) and
 *    the mutation to `false` is silently ignored. That failure mode is
 *    especially nasty here, because the test it breaks is the one asserting the
 *    feature is OFF: it would have reported the safeguarding gate as working
 *    while never actually exercising it.
