/**
 * Which admin pages enforce a PERMISSION, stated once instead of discovered by
 * reading forty-one files.
 *
 * `STAFF_ROUTES` answers "must you be signed in?" and it listed /settings
 * correctly. Nothing answered the next question — "signed in as WHOM?" — and
 * /settings answered it only by hiding its nav link. On 2026-08-31, signed in
 * to production as Simon Binder (JOBCOACH / OWN_DOMAIN / isSystemAdmin false),
 * typing the URL served the whole page, including a roster of every
 * colleague's login CODE. A staff code is the credential — `loginByCode` takes
 * it with no password — so the narrowest role in the product could read
 * `AOZ-ADMIN1` and sign in as the system administrator.
 *
 * The page was not careless: it gated the invite form and the config fields.
 * That is the trap worth naming — gating the WRITE affordances looks like
 * access control and reads as thorough, while the page and its payload stay
 * open. A hidden link is not a boundary.
 *
 * So this file makes the guard a declared fact per page. Adding an admin page
 * fails the suite until you say what it requires — and the pages that
 * deliberately require only a session are listed, so "no permission needed"
 * is a decision somebody wrote down rather than a line nobody got to.
