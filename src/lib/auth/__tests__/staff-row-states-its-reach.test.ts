/**
 * Every place that CREATES a staff row must say how much that person sees.
 *
 * Role, reach and administration used to be one enum, so `role: 'ADMIN'` was a
 * complete description of a staff row and every creation site was correct by
 * saying one thing. Splitting them into three columns quietly invalidated all
 * five of those sites at once: the same line now produces a row holding the
 * column DEFAULTS.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical, and it is not a test-only concern. It shipped:
 *
 *   - The data migration backfilled `scope`/`isSystemAdmin` for rows that
 *     already existed (`WHERE role = 'ADMIN'`). Seeding is the OTHER way an
 *     admin is born, and it runs AFTER the migration, so on a freshly created
 *     database the bootstrap admin came out `OWN_DOMAIN`, `isSystemAdmin:
 *     false` — an instance with no system administrator and an unreachable
 *     settings page. CI caught it only because four E2E specs happen to open
 *     `/settings`; nothing in `npm run verify` could see it.
 *
 * The general shape is the one this repo keeps meeting: a field added to a
 * model is fine, and a field added to a model that FIVE call sites must each
 * remember is a countdown. So the gate is on the call sites, not on the
 * schema — it reads the source and requires the reach to be present in the
 * payload, whether stated field-by-field or spread from an SSOT.
 *
 * An allowlist of "the files I thought of" cannot catch the file nobody
 * thought of, so the list of sites is DISCOVERED by scanning, and the test
 * fails if scanning finds none (which would mean the scan itself broke).
