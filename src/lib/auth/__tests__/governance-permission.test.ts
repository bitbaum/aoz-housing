/**
 * Answering a household's proposals is not the same job as running its
 * building.
 *
 * WHAT SHIPPED, AND FOR HOW LONG: every action in `lib/actions/governance.ts`
 * took `requireStaffAuth()` — signed in, nothing more. Ten of them. So any
 * staff member could confirm a house decision, create or archive an AOZ rule,
 * close voting or advance a conflict stage, including two roles that cannot
 * see /rules in their own navigation. The menu honoured a boundary the code
 * did not, exactly as the message and maintenance surfaces once did.
 *
 * The /rules PAGE had no permission check either — `requireStaffAuth()` while
 * its nav entry declared `housing:read`.
 *
 * And the dashboard queue for it was gated on `housing:read`, which was a fair
 * approximation while `housing:read` implied a care role. Adding
 * LIEGENSCHAFTEN broke that silently: Manuel holds `housing:read` to run the
 * building stock, and it handed him the queue where SAFETY and
 * NON-DISCRIMINATION proposals land — the topics this product refuses to put
 * to a vote precisely because a majority must not decide them.
 *
 * Found by opening the dashboard as Manuel.
