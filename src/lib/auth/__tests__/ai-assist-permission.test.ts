/**
 * The KI-Assistent is a drafting aid, and every care role writes.
 *
 * It used to ride on `residents:write`, which is a permission about creating
 * and editing CLIENT RECORDS — nothing to do with drafting text. The symptom
 * was precise and backwards: the two roles who write the most prose in this
 * product, a Jobcoach (CVs, references) and a Freiwilligenarbeit coordinator
 * (listings), were the two the nav hid it from. Verified live on 2026-09-03 as
 * both Simon and Sandra: their entire user menu was Algorithmus and Hilfe.
 *
 * The second half was worse. `/api/ai/chat` and `/api/ai/form-assist` checked
 * only that a session existed, so the API served exactly the people the nav
 * told it was not for them — a declared boundary differing from the enforced
 * one, which is the same defect that let the `/algorithm` mismatch survive.
