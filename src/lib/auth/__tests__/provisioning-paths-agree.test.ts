/**
 * The two ways to create a colleague must accept the same roles.
 *
 * This product has provisioned staff through two endpoints since the role split:
 * `/api/auth/register` (admin-only, code returned) and `/api/auth/invite`
 * (admin-only, code emailed). They have now diverged TWICE.
 *
 * The first time was the permission check — `register`'s docstring said
 * admin-only while the code checked only that you were signed in, so any
 * authenticated Jobcoach could mint themselves a Leitung account. Fixed, and
 * the comment left behind in that file says "the two provisioning paths simply
 * disagreed".
 *
 * The second time was this one, and it survived because nobody looked for the
 * same class again: `invite` validated with `isStaffRole`, which accepts the
 * RETIRED `ADMIN`, while `register` had refused it since the split. The
 * settings form — the only staff-creation UI in the product — posts to
 * `invite`, and its dropdown offered "Leitung".
 *
 * So the rule is asserted about the SHARED source of truth rather than about
 * either route's implementation, and the source files are read to prove that
 * neither has quietly gone back to its own list.
