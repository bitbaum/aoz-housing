/**
 * Project a whole Resident row down to what may cross to a client component.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the bug it prevents is invisible in the type checker.
 * `src/app/(admin)/housing/[id]/page.tsx` reads whole Resident rows (Prisma
 * returns every scalar when no `select` is given) because server-side
 * compatibility math (`toResidentProfile`, `getUnitFitConcerns`) needs the full
 * functional field set. Those same rows were then passed straight into client
 * components — `ApartmentProfileCard`, `ProblemDetectionCard`,
 * `CompatibilityMatrixInteractive`, `RoomVisualizationWithPlacement` — whose
 * props are typed as the NARROW `ResidentSummary`/`…HouseholdProfile`/`…Basic`.
 *
 * TypeScript accepts a wider object where a narrower one is expected
 * (structural typing), so it compiled green — but **Next serializes the object
 * actually passed, not the type it was passed as**, into the page's HTML flight
 * payload. That put caseworker `notes`, `supportLevel`, `bio`, and the
 * `medicalDoc*` / `hasMedicalDocumentation` fields — about refugees — into the
 * page source of a staff screen.
 *
 * So the projection has to happen at the boundary, in code, not be left to the
 * prop type. Call this at every point a resident row crosses into a client
 * component. `code` stays because this repo treats it as semi-public (the login
 * reference, like a room number); the medical and caseworker fields do not.
