/**
 * The resident portal must not render German from the staff label config.
 *
 * The portal is translated into eleven languages. The staff UI is German by
 * decision. Both are right — and the seam between them leaks: a portal file
 * that imports `ACTIVITY_CATEGORY_LABELS` renders "Sport / Sprache / Kultur"
 * inside an otherwise Russian page, and every check stays green, because a
 * German string is a perfectly valid string. The coverage gate can only see
 * keys that EXIST; it is blind to a label that never went through the
 * dictionary at all.
 *
 * This is the systemic version of the bug, so it gets a systemic check: no
 * file under the portal may import a `*_LABELS` map from the config or
 * constants layers. Translated labels live in `lib/i18n/*-labels.ts`, keyed by
 * the same id unions, so the mapping still cannot drift.
 *
 * KNOWN_LEAKS is the debt that existed when this gate was written, listed file
 * by file rather than summarised — a count would let the list quietly grow
 * back. Entries come OFF this list as they are translated; nothing may be
 * added without deleting a line here, which is a decision someone has to make
 * on purpose.
