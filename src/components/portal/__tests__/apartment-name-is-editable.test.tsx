/**
 * The apartment name is editable where it is shown.
 *
 * WHAT SHIPPED: `ApartmentNameEditor` was complete — guarded, validated,
 * translated into every offered language — and rendered by NOTHING. It had
 * been built for `/portal/apartment`, and when that page was retired to a
 * redirect its editor stayed behind: half a pair, deleted halfway.
 *
 * `PATCH /api/portal/apartment` kept working the entire time — auth-checked,
 * audited, and reachable by no control a resident could press. So the portal
 * displayed "Singapur" at the top of the housing card, offered no way to
 * change it, and CLAUDE.md went on stating that any current resident may set
 * it. Nothing failed: an unrendered component type-checks, lints, and even
 * passes its own tests.
 *
 * Found by grepping for components that nothing imports, after deleting four
 * dead dashboard components — the same sweep, one file further down.
