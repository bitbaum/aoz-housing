/**
 * What this client is currently unterwegs on, on their own dossier.
 *
 * ## Why this card had to exist
 *
 * `listApplicationsForResident` was written, exported — and called by nothing.
 * A coach opening a client could see their learning records, their incidents,
 * their placements and their care team, and NOT the one thing they had asked
 * for themselves.
 *
 * That became load-bearing the moment the dashboard learned to say "Interesse
 * wartet auf Antwort — George B" and linked to `/residents/<id>`: the tile
 * named a person, the page it opened did not mention the thread, and the coach
 * had to guess which of the listings it was. A queue whose destination cannot
 * show the work is a queue nobody can clear.
 *
 * Read-only on purpose. The stage controls live on the listing, next to
 * everyone else on it, and a second set of them here would be two places to
 * move one thread from. The link goes there instead.
