/**
 * What a specialist sees before anyone has been assigned to their seat.
 *
 * The same distinction `EmptyWorkspaceState` draws, one level in: there,
 * every queue is empty because the database is; here, every queue is empty
 * because this person's seat holds nobody. Both look identical to a
 * `.length === 0` check, and both were reported as "🎉 Alles unter
 * Kontrolle! Keine dringenden Aufgaben".
 *
 * That is what Simon Binder and Sandra were shown on their first ever login
 * on 2026-08-31 — a party emoji and a finished day, on an account nobody had
 * connected to a single client. The product's answer to "why is this empty?"
 * was "because you are done".
 *
 * So: neutral, never a tick, and it names WHERE the seat is filled. The care
 * seat is assigned in the Betreuungsteam panel on a client's own page, which
 * is not somewhere you would guess from a dashboard — and a specialist can
 * assign their own seat, so this is a step they can actually take rather
 * than a request to go and find somebody.
