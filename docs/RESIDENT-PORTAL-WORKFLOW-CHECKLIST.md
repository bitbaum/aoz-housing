---

## 9) Reliability & Regression

## Sign-off

Date: 2026-02-18 (Pass 1 + Pass 2 extended live)
Tester: Anthropig
Environment: local code review + lint/tests + authenticated live browser pass (Chrome relay)

Summary:
- Passed: 54
- Minor/needs live confirmation: 17
- Not checked yet: 0 workflow items (only legend placeholder remains)
- Blockers: 0
- Notes:
  - "Vorlage zurücksetzen" clears prefill but keeps currently selected category form open (likely acceptable, slightly confusing).
  - Some UI submits intermittently showed loading states in relay sessions, but backend/API confirmations succeeded for core flows.
  - One console 400 was observed during intentional negative validation testing (expected behavior, not a product regression).
  - Browser relay intermittency remains an environment risk during long interactive runs.
- Go/No-Go: **Go** for resident portal v1.1 (no critical blocker found).
