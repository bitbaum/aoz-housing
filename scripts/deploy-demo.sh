#
# Deploy the AOZ demo instance (https://aoz.orangecat.ch).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
# -----------------------------------
# The real deployment (aoz-wohnen.orangecat.ch) is push-to-master CD via
# fleetcrown's reusable `selfhost-deploy.yml`. This demo instance is NOT on
# that pipeline yet: it is a second app on the same box, and registering a new
# app is a change in the fleetcrown repo, not this one.
#
# So this script is the honest interim — a named, committed, repeatable
# procedure rather than a sequence someone has to remember. Until the instance
# is registered for CD, **a push to master does not update aoz.orangecat.ch**;
# this script does.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE BUILD AT ALL
# ---------------------------
# `NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND` is inlined at BUILD time, so an AOZ-branded instance
# cannot be served from the WG-branded build the CD pipeline produces. Two
# brands means two builds means two deployments.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH
# -----------------------------------
# /opt/aoz-wohnen, the aoz_wohnen database, and the real Witikonerstrasse data.
# The demo has its own app dir, its own database, its own role, its own systemd
# unit and its own session secret — a cookie minted here is not valid there.

# build started anywhere those are absent dies at page-data collection with an
# error that reads like a code fault and is not one.
#
# "Anywhere" very much includes a git WORKTREE: `.env` is gitignored, so it
# exists in the main checkout and in none of the worktrees agents actually work
# in — the script ran fine for whoever wrote it and failed for the next person
# on the same commit. Pulling from the box removes the question.

# `contactNote` and `claimedAt` reached the CODE and never the demo DATABASE,
# so /portal/marketplace 500'd while this script printed success.
#
# The real instance's CD runs migrations; this one is a second app on the same
# box and has to do it itself. Postgres here only accepts 127.0.0.1, so the
# migration runs ON the box against its own loopback.
#
# Drizzle migrations are plain forward-only SQL, applied with psql against the
# demo's own DATABASE_URL and ledgered in public._deploy_schema_history — the
# same ledger fleetcrown's apply-schema.sh keeps for the real instance, so both
# databases answer "what has been applied" the same way. Each file runs in a
# single transaction (-1); a failure aborts the deploy before the restart.
