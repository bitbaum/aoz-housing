# Demo guide

created_date: 2026-01-24
last_modified_date: 2026-09-07
last_modified_summary: Rewritten. The old script sold "an intelligent matching system", quoted a resident code that no longer exists, and sent people to an /analytics/roi page that was never built.

The demo is **not a separate product**. It is the real tool behind a door that
needs no account, filled with a seeded narrative. What a visitor clicks is what
AOZ staff use.

## The doors

Live on <https://aoz.orangecat.ch/login> — the page asks the server which doors
exist, so a button only appears when pressing it can succeed.

| Door | Code | Lands on |
|---|---|---|
| Staff | `WG-DEMO01` | the Verwaltung side, full admin session |
| Klient\*in | `RES-DEMO1` | the portal, as Fatima — placed, with a lived-in flat |

Codes are configured on the box (`DEMO_STAFF_CODE`, `DEMO_RESIDENT_CODE`).
Verified live 2026-09-07. The demo world is re-seeded nightly at 04:05 UTC, so
anything a visitor changes is gone by morning — and the reset deletes strictly
by code prefix, never by table, so it cannot touch the real flat that lives in
the same database.

## What the demo is actually showing

Lead with the problem, not the algorithm. Placement is the base layer, not the
product:

1. **Stability** — who lives where, who fits whom, and what happens when it
   breaks: the conflict ladder, incidents, maintenance.
2. **Capability** — Einsatzplätze, learning records, what a person can show an
   employer.
3. **Participation** — house rules the household actually votes on, chores,
   shared expenses, the marketplace.
4. **Guidance** — one care team across domains, appointments, and the client's
   own record: insurance, health professionals, permit.

Every score is explainable, and that is the point worth making out loud: open a
placement and it says *why this home*; open the match list and it says what
ranked it. `/algorithm` documents the dimensions and their weights.

## The narrative is code, not prose

The seeded story lives in `src/lib/demo/seed-data.ts` and
`src/lib/demo/seed-governance.ts` — five units, fifteen residents, incidents,
expenses, chores with an uneven completion record, and proposals at every
stage. Read those files rather than a script that paraphrases them; a
paraphrase is what let the previous version of this guide go stale.

Two details in the seed are deliberate and worth knowing before you present:

- **A vote is already open, backdated.** Voting opens only after a three-day
  discussion window and the world is wiped nightly, so a proposal created fresh
  could never reach a ballot in a demo. One seat is left empty on purpose — the
  visitor casts the deciding vote.
- **Outcome text comes from the real `tallyVotes()`.** A demo that explained a
  result differently from the product would be a demo of something that does
  not exist.

## What NOT to say

- ~~"This is our intelligent matching system."~~ It undersells the product by
  about four fifths, and it is the framing this guide used to open with.
- Do not quote resident codes from memory. The demo prefix follows the brand
  (`KL-DEMO…` on the AOZ brand, `RES-DEMO…` historically); Ahmed, the unplaced
  client in the placement story, is `KL-DEMO14` on the live instance, not the
  `RES-AH014` this guide claimed for months.
- There is no ROI dashboard route. Pilot evidence lives on `/analytics`.

## Running it locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev            # port 3000
pnpm run db:seed        # demo data
```

`pnpm`, not `npm` — the fleet has one package manager.
